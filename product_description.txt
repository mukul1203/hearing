A simple web page that only does one thing - plays an audio.
Which audio? I need not supply as a user. 
It just picks in sequence from a series of audios that are present in a given
folder in my google drive.
The audio player has a backend as another github repository - https://github.com/mukul1203/hearing_db
The player uses this repository to commit to a json file that acts as a backend
database. In this database, player records the timestamp whenever I start and stop playing
an audio.
When I load the webpage from any device, it should pick the audio and timestamp from
backend and resume from there (actually resume from 5 mins before that timestamp to restore context)

I want to host the webpage on github pages.

I will provide the needed credentials like github api token and google drive token.
The credentials must be stored somewhere safe which is accessible to the webpage.
You need to suggest me options for this.

Your task is to write a very minimal and simple webpage in plain html, css and javascript.
